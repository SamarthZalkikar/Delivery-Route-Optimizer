"""
dsa/graph.py -- Unit-III graph algorithms over an ADJACENCY-LIST graph.

Used BY the app for:
  * BFS / DFS traversals            (Network tab, /api/traverse)
  * connected components            (DSU-backed)
  * Dijkstra shortest paths         (feeds the route optimizer's distance matrix)
  * Prim & Kruskal MSTs side by side
Design: node ids are ints 0..n-1, adjacency is a plain LIST OF LISTS
(neighbor lists), no dict/set inside the algorithms.
